      <p>What is pair programming?</p>
      <ul>
           <li>Collaborative work on writing code</li>
           <li>Usually done between two programmers working on one project</li>
           <li>Can be done physically or remotely</li>
      </ul>  
    </div>

    <div class ="right1">
      <p>Why is pair programming important to DBC?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Can learn from your pair</li>
        <li>Real world practice , good to be ready for it</li>
        <li>Allows for feedback after pairing session that helps you improve</li>
      </ul>   
    </div>
    
    <div class = "left2"></p>
      <p>Driver vs Navigator</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Navigator is the like a co-pilot, looking ahead, helping to test code and research code</li>
        <li>Driver is in charge of implementation, but not only typing, can put in what he thinks works</li>
      </ul>

    <div class = "right2">
      <p>Our experience</p>
      <ul>  
      	<li>So far only a few guided pairing sessions - its been fun</li>
      	<li>Team feeling</li>
      </ul>  
    </div>

    <div id="footer"><u>Personal Reflection:</u> This is my second GPS and I'm still getting used to this navigator/driver thing but it has been fun and I'm always learning from both the colleagues and the guides.During this session we followed the guide's instruction to not put the navigator in a role of <i>backseat driver</i>, since the driver should know what he is doing and not just type whatever the navigator says. This strategy worked well! Overall our section went very smoothly and we could establish a good comunication. In my opinion what didn't work very well was the use of Stypi tool for HTML. We wasted a lot of time copying and pasting the code in the sublime to see the result of our changes in the browser. For HTML, this tool is not very practical.

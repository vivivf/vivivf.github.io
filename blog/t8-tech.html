        <h3>Regular Expressions</h3>
        <h5>November 30, 2014</h5>
        <p>For this week's blog I chose a topic that I considered very useful and powerful: regular expression.</p>

        <p>Have you ever needed to look for a specific word in a long text and replace it for something else? Have you ever wanted to find all the words that match a specific pattern? I'm pretty sure the answer is yes and the good news is: regular expressions can help you with that.</p>

        <p>Regular expression, or regex for short, is used to search texts that match a specific pattern. The pattern is described by the expression, which is nothing more than a group of characters or wildcards. It takes time to get used to regular expressions, since it is not easy to identify what the patterns are describing, but the good thing is that there is plenty of documentation in the web about regex. </p>

        <p>Many programming languages support regex, but they can have slight differences in the implementation, so when using regex be aware of that and make sure you are using the correct syntax.</p>

        <p>Before we start playing with some examples, let's talk about some basic definitions.</p>

        <p>The expressions are formed by literal and metacharacters. Literal characters are all the characters that do not have a special meaning, so they are literally the characters that we want to find. Examples of literal characters are: A, 1, ! 
        Metacharacters have special meaning, so they cannot be used as literal in the the search expression. Examples of metacharacters are: ^, \, $, * The metacharaters can be identified as literal using what we call escape. The metacharacter \ is used to escape other metacharacters. So, if you want to look for $20 in a text, the expression would look like this: \$20. Note that the \ metacharacter is placed before the $. In this way, the $ will be interpreted as a literal character.</p>

        <p>The metacharacters can have different meanings depending on how they are combined and/or positioned in the expression, so it is difficult to make a list explaining what each one does. I prefer to give some examples to try to clarify the syntax, so let's start.</p>

<pre><code>2.0.0-p451 :117 > "Testing REGEX!!!".match(/(Test)/)
 => # MatchData "Test" 1:"Test"
</code></pre>

        <p>This is a ruby example. It is using the method match with a regular expression. As you can see, the result of the command was "Test", since the expression was only looking for the Test text in the string "Testing REGEX!!!". What if we want to filter only the capital letters after the space, in this case, the REGEX text. </p>

<pre><code>2.0.0-p451 :121 > "Testing REGEX!!!".match(/\s([A-Z]*)/)
 => #MatchData " REGEX" 1:"REGEX"></code></pre>
 
        <p>The command above is using the shorthand character \s to matches a whitespace. After the \s there is the metacharacter [ ], which is used to matches a letter from A to Z. The [ ] matches only one occurrence, so if we don't use the * metacharacter, the result will be "R". See bellow:</p>

<pre><code>2.0.0-p451 :127 > "Testing REGEX!!!".match(/\s([A-Z])/)
 => #MatchData " R" 1:"R"></code></pre>

        <p>We could also use the metacharacter ^ inside the brackets to negates the expression, so if we only want the capital letters, the expression would be [^a-z]. Check it out:</p>

<pre><code>2.0.0-p451 :128 > "Testing REGEX!!!".match(/\s([^a-z]*)/)
 => #MatchData " REGEX!!!" 1:"REGEX!!!"></code></pre>

        <p>The result is almost the same, the difference is that here it includes the !!!, since the metacharacter is matching everything except by the a-z range.</p>

        <p>As mentioned above, the metacharacters can have different meanings depending on their position in the expression. The ^ is a good example. Take a look at the following example.</p>

<pre><code>2.0.0-p451 :147 > "Testing REGEX!!!".match(/(^T\w*)/)
 => #MatchData "Testing" 1:"Testing"></code></pre>

        <p>Here the ^T is matching everything that starts with T, so the meaning of the ^ metacharacter outside the brackets is different. The /w is a shorthand that matches any character in the range 0 - 9, A - Z and a - z. The result is Testing, since we are matching the first letter equal to T and all the characters in the range 0 - 9, A - Z and a - z. As there is a space in the middle, the rest of the text is not part of the result.</p>
 
        <p>In the case we wanted to match the whole sentence, we could use:</p>

<pre><code>2.0.0-p451 :149 > "Testing REGEX!!!".match(/(^T\w*)\s([^a-z]*)/)
 => #MatchData "Testing REGEX!!!" 1:"Testing" 2:"REGEX!!!"></code></pre>

        <p>or</p>

<pre><code>2.0.0-p451 :154 > "Testing REGEX!!!".match(/(\w*)\s(\w*!!!)/)
 => #MatchData "Testing REGEX!!!" 1:"Testing" 2:"REGEX!!!"></code></pre>

        <p>In the second example I included the ! character since the \w does not match this kind of character. There are plenty of ways to do that, here are some of them:</p>

<pre><code>2.0.0-p451 :160 >"Testing REGEX!!!".match(/(\w*)\s(\w*)(!{3})/)
=> #MatchData "Testing REGEX!!!" 1:"Testing" 2:"REGEX" 3:"!!!"></code></pre>

        <p>In this case the {3} is specifying that the ! should appear exactly 3 times to be matched. If we change the number to 4 it will not match.</p>

<pre><code>2.0.0-p451 :169 > "Testing REGEX!!!".match(/(\w*)\s(\w*)(!+)/)
 => #MatchData "Testing REGEX!!!" 1:"Testing" 2:"REGEX" 3:"!!!"></code></pre>

        <p>The metacharacter +(plus) matches when the preceding character occurs 1 or more times, as the ! occurs 3 times, it will match.</p>

        <p>Now, let's see a more useful example. Imagine that you have a list of contacts, but you want to select only the telephone number. If all the phone numbers have the same pattern, we can use a regular expression to filter them. Here is how we can do that:</p>

<pre><code>2.0.0-p451 :201 > "John Lake (555) 123-4567".match(/\(\d{3}\) \d{3}-\d{4}/)
 => #MatchData "(555) 123-4567"></code></pre>

        <p>The string of the example has a name and a number. The expression is looking only for the number. We start from the ( character. As it is a special character and we want it to be interpreted as literal character, we use the back slash \ to escape it. After that, the \d shorthand is used to match the digits and the {3} is fixing the number of digits to 3. The next step is to use the \ again to scape the closing ). The \d{3} is mattching the next 3 digits after the space and the last part is matching the last 4 digits after the -. The result returned the number since it is exactly in this format. If the number was not in this format, the command would return nil.</p>

        <p>Regex is very powerful and useful to parse any text data. This post covered some basic and simple regular expressions, but there is much more to explore. </p>

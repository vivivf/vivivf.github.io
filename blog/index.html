           <h2>Git & GitHub: basic concepts</h2>
           <h2 id="date">October 10, 2014</h2>
           <div id="content">
              <p>This is the first week of DBC and I'm glad I have already learned a lot. I've used Git and GitHub before, but the concepts were not very clear to me. Now I feel more confident to execute the commands and make changes without "breaking" anything. Here are some basic concepts that we went through during the course of the week.

<b>What are the benefits of version control?</b>

Version control is the process of managing changes of documents/files. Developers use version control to keep track of changes made in the code. It is much easier to maintain and work on a code when it is possible to track what was changed, when the change was made and by whom. The version control allows the developers to make changes and tests in a "copy" of the original code, so in the case of failures it is easy to rollback to the previous version. It is also useful in the case that there is a group of people working in the same code, since it is possible to merge the versions with the individual contributions to create a new one.

<b>How does git help you keep track of changes</b>?

Git is a software control system that has many features that make the developer's life easier when it comes to tracking changes in the code. It is possible to track which files were changed, created and deleted if compared to a specific version. The changes can be saved or discarded. You can also rollback a change that was already saved, since it creates a checkpoint every time a change is saved.
Git also allows the creation of "branches", that are copies of the repository. Different people can work in different branches and merge their branches to have a single version with all the contributions. 

<b>Why use GitHub to store your code?</b>

GitHub is a the remote repository that can be accessed by anyone who has an internet connection and of course, permission to access the repository. GitHub is very useful for sharing code and for working in groups, since several people can access the same remote repository and work in the same project by dowloading/uploading the changes from/to each individual local repository. </p>

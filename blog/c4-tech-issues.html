        <h3>Tech World Issues: Big data & Analytics x Privacy</h3>
        <h5>November 2, 2014</h5>
        <p> With the popularization of internet and social networks, data is becoming each day a more valuable asset. Companies are investing in the collection and analysis of user data in order to know better their customers and to define the business strategies.</p>

        <p>Big data and data analytics are the new trends in the tech world, but what about the privacy? How can we protect our personal data?</p>

        <p>The truth is that our personal data is everywhere. Have you ever tried to google your name? Well, you'll probably see that the internet knows more about you than you expected.</p>

        <p>We share our information when we use the social networks like facebook, twitter, linkedin. We share our information when we buy something on amazon. We share our information when check in in places through apps. We are sharing our information all the time.</p>

        <p>Companies realized that they can use all this information in their benefit. They can process the information to get real valuable data. Depending on the industry the data can be used in a different way to generate a business competitive advantage. One example is the use of customer data to define marketing strategy.</p>

        <p>When you buy something in amazon you will see that there are suggestions of what else you could buy. These suggestions are made based on your web clickstream history. They know which products you have already checked, so they can analyze what you would probably buy. This is only one example of how an ecommerce business can increase the sales by analyzing data.</p>

        <p>The problem is that the use of personal information can sometimes go too far. A case that became very famous and illustrates very well the abuse of information usage happened with Target, a big american retail chain. Target was analyzing the changes in the shopping habits to predict woman's pregnancy, then they could make the relevant advertisements. This "marketing activity" resulted in a dad finding out that his teenager daughter was pregnant before she had told anyone.</p>

        <p>This is only one example, but it is clear that the violation of privacy is a huge issue for big data and analytics solutions. Regulators, legislators and citizens have already raised the concerns about the unrestrained use of personal information. This discussion will not end soon, it is just starting. The organizations need to start planning privacy strategies to be able to keep the data exploration without affecting the citizens rights.</p>

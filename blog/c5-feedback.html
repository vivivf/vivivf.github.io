           <div id="content">
              <p>We are at the fifth week of the DBC Phase 0 and up to now I've paired with several people. Although I would love to pair again with some of the people I've paired, I'm trying to pair with different people every time. I think it is important to know the feeling of pairing with people with different knowledge levels, different ways of communicating and different ways of interacting. Knowing the feeling make easier to deal with the most diverse situations that will arise when you are working together with different people.

I personally have a mix of feelings about the pairing experience. Pairing can be awesome, but it can also be very frustrating. When pairing you have the chance to get in contact with different views and different approaches to solve technical problems, you practice your communication skills, you socialize. All of this is really good and important, but we have to remember that different people have different ways of working, thinking and dealing with problems. Divergent opinions and behavours have to managed and it is definitely not easy. In the same way we face problems dealing with people in the everyday life, we face problems working with people. I believe the key for having good paring experiences is to learn how to manage the expectations and how to give/receive feedback. 

The feedback is a very important part of any group work. Being able to receive feedback without taking it personally can sometimes be difficult, but is essential.  Giving actionable, specific and kind feedback is also not easy.

Most of the feedbacks that I received for the pairing sessions were kind, not all of them were specific and actionable. I also didn't get a high rate for all the feedbacks I gave, but I see this as a work in progress. We'll "improve our skills" of giving feedback with the practice. I also think that is going to be easier to give feedback when we know better each other. It is always more comfortable to talk what you think to someone you know.

In summary, my perception is that the pairing sessions can help us a lot in many aspects, but we have to be prepared to face some difficult situations. As the "perfection" always come with the practice, the best way to have good experiences is practicing :)

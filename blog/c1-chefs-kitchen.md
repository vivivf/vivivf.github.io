DBC Culture and Approach to Learn

1st Cultural Blog Post - week1

October 10, 2014

Well, where do I start? So many things running through my mind after this week, and I know that there is muuuuch more to come...

First of all, I'm not a "blogger" kind of person. I'm not used to share my thoughts with people, so I'm making a big effort to getting better on this. It has been tough and sometimes takes me too much time trying to pick right words, but I'm loving the experience. It is something that I want and I need to develop, so being out of my comfort zone will for sure make me learn a lot. 

I think the experience in the DBC is all about that. As Shereef mentioned in the video, you can have two different approaches when attending to the DBC. The first one is to treat it as package that you bought and just expect to receive the *service*, as a consumer. The second one is about making your own experience, making it to be awesome, learn as much as you can, put a lot of dedication and doing all of that engaged with the team. Of course everybody expects to have good teachers, good lectures, good material, but the success of the program depends much more on ourselves than anything else.

I'm total aligned with the second approach and I'm really excited to make this bootcamp an amazing experience together with my class mates and teachers. I'm pretty sure we have a lot to learn from each other!

           <div id="content">
              <p> During the preparation for starting my journey at Devbootcamp I took a test to identify my thinking style. The result showed that I'm a concrete sequential thinker, which is exactly what I was expecting.

According to the test, a concrete sequential thinker learns better in a structured environment, likes to follow directions and to work with a logical sequence. I totally see myself in this description. I also identify myself with some of the things that are considered hard for concrete sequential thinkers, such as dealing with abstract ideas and discussions that seem to have no specify point.

Some characteristics of my way of thinking can help me in the Devbootcamp journey and recognizing the ones that in some way could make my path harder is the first step to try to avoid a bad impact.

The experience of the first 3 weeks of Phase 0 was very rich. I have worked with so many different people and it is really interesting to pay attention and analyze the behavior of each one. Each person has a different way of thinking and this contact allow us to learn from each other. 

I received a very nice feedback from someone who told me that my way of structuring the tasks and thinking in a logical sequence has helped him to organize his ideas and to be more effective when working on the challenges. It was really gratifying to hear this! I hope to keep helping people each day more.

I have also learned a lot from my classmates. Something that is hard for me is to use my imagination. I'm not the very creative kind of person and I got really amazed with the creativity of some people from this group. The week2, when we had to build our own website was really tough for me, but the pairing sessions helped me a lot. I felt inspired by some people's ideas which helped me to develop my own ideas. 

We all have a lot of things to learn, some things are harder to some people and easier to others and vice-versa, but we have to take advantage of having a rich mixture of skills and characteristics and learn from each other. 

I believe people can change and develop new skills. This is what the growth intelligence mindset is about. It values the learning from failure. A growth intelligence mindset seeks for challenges and doesn't feel bad for failing. The failure is seen as part of the development and growth process.

My strategy for the rest of the bootcamp will be based on the growth intelligence mindset. I know my weaknesses and I'll try to work on them by observing the people that inspires me and trying to learn from them. I know that sometimes I'll fail, but this is part of the game ;)

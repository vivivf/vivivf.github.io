           <div id="content">
              <p>Some years ago I was on a business travel with a coworker that is also a very close friend. There was a holiday right after the day we were supposed to finish our job, so we decided to extend our stay to visit Paris. This is where the nightmare started. 

We are very close friends, but we had never traveled together just the two of us. We have very different habits and this made the trip very difficult. 
The first disagreement was about the hotel. I wanted to stay close to downtown even if I had to spend more money while he preferred a cheaper place, not so close to downtown but close to the subway. We decided for staying in the cheaper option. 

When we got to Paris we found out that there was a full strike on subways and buses. We were far from downtown and if we canceled the hotel we wouldn't get any refund. We didn't have many choices, so we decided to stay in the hotel. 
As there was no subway my initial plan was to take a cab to go to downtown, since we were more than 1 hour walking from there. When we asked in the front desk about the average price of a ride to downtown we wanted to cry, it was ridiculously expensive. Anyway, I was still willing to pay, since we would divide by 2, but my friend convinced me to go walking. At this time I thought, what else can go wrong? 
Well, many other things went wrong during this trip. My friend loves museums and I like, but I don't want to spend my whole day staring at paints and sculptures. I really don't need to see every single piece of every session of the museum, and this is exactly what my friend did. 

At the end of the day I was really tired and I felt I didn't do anything I enjoy. I just wanted to have a good dinner and go to the bed, but again the dinner was not what I was expecting since my friend preferred to eat in a very simple place to save money. After the dinner he suggested to come back to hotel walking and this was the last straw. I couldn't stand that situation anymore. I tried to avoid discussing with my friend the whole day, but at this point I was so pissed that I couldn't control my emotions. We discussed and it was really really bad. 

We went over all of this and we are still good friends but if I could I would change everything that I did since the travel planning. I avoided all the conflicts with my friend since the beginning but deep in my heart I was not happy with the decisions we made, so I got frustrated and that made me had a very tough discussion with him. 

Today I see that avoiding the conflicts was not good for neither of us. We should have talked/discussed more about all the disagreements to find a balance, where both of us were satisfied with all the decisions. I learnt from this experience that it is important to try to be comfortable to express opinions and to handle conflicts in a good way.
